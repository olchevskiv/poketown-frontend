            Poketown is a fictional Poké bowl restaurant created out of my love for Poké bowls and web design! I spent about a week working and refining this website to be my version of my dream Poké restaurant web application. I order custom Poké bowls from my local restaurants almost every week and from ordering online, and one day when I was ordering my weekly Poké bowl, I realized I wanted to create my own improved version of the site.

            <div className="text-lg">
            Poké is native Hawaiian cuisine, traditionally made up of diced fresh fish served as an appetizer or main course. 
            Modern twists by poké bowl companies include chicken, tofu, shrimp or salmon with strong influences of Japanese and Korean cuisine. 
            Think of it as deconstructed sushi with all your favorite proteins, mix-ins, toppings and crunches with your favorite sauces!
